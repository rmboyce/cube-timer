# Cube Timer

A timer for speedcubing. 

Uses PyQt for the windowing. The timer starts when the spacebar is released and ends when it is pressed. It also creates a text file called previous_solves.txt that includes your previous solves and their respective dates. The times only register if you hit the spacebar to show a new scramble or switch tabs.
